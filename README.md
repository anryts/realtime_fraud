For my coursework in Big Data Processing, I explored various approaches to detecting fraudulent transactions in near real-time (within 5 seconds). 
The study involved multiple methods, ranging from simple statistical techniques like the Interquartile Range (IQR) to more advanced machine learning models such as Random Forest.

Additionally, I experimented with hybrid techniques, including IQR combined with Random Forest and Isolation Forest with adaptive retraining on small, recent data partitions to deal with data shifts. 
The results of these experiments and their comparative effectiveness are summarized in presentation.pdf [(url)](https://github.com/anryts/realtime_fraud/blob/master/presentation.pdf). <br>
Feel free to review it for more details.
